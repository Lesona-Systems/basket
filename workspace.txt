What do we want it to do?

- When things are scanned, do we have it already or do we not?
- if we don't, display a page where we can add information about the product
- if we do, show total count of product prior to scan, plus +1 for current scan (autoaccept scan)
- once scan accepted, clear window and start over with barcode scan cta
